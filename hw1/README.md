# HW1: Traditional Information Retrieval Methods

In this assignment, we implement following methods:

- Vector Space Model (TF-IDF)
- Probabilic Models:
    - Binary Independence Model (BIM)
    - Okapi BM25

And we evaluate the methods using:
- P@K
- P@10
- MAP (Mean Average Precision)
- MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)
