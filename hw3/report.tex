here is the error function and its gradient:
MSE: 
\[
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\]

Gradient with respect to weights:
\[
\nabla_{\text{weights}} = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i \cdot (y_i - \hat{y}_i)
\]

Gradient with respect to bias:
\[
\nabla_{\text{bias}} = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)
\]
